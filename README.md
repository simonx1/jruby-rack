# JRuby-Rack

JRuby-Rack is a lightweight adapter for the Java servlet environment
that allows any Rack-based application to run unmodified in a Java
servlet container. JRuby-Rack supports Rails, Merb, as well as any
Rack-compatible Ruby web framework.

For more information on Rack, visit http://rack.rubyforge.org.

# Getting Started

The easiest way to use JRuby-Rack is to get [Warbler][1]. Warbler
depends on the latest version of JRuby-Rack and ensures it gets placed in
your WAR file when it gets built.

If you're assembling your own WAR using other means, you can install the
`jruby-rack` gem. It provides a method to located the jruby-rack jar file:

    require 'fileutils'
    require 'jruby-rack'
    FileUtils.cp JRubyJars.jruby_rack_jar_path, '.'

Otherwise you'll need to download the [latest JRuby-Rack jar][2], drop
it into the WEB-INF/lib directory and configure the RackFilter in your
application's web.xml. Example web.xml snippets are as follows.

## For Rails

Here's sample web.xml configuration for Rails. Note the environment
and min/max runtime parameters. For multi-threaded Rails with a single
runtime, set min/max both to 1. Otherwise, define the size of the
runtime pool as you wish.

    <context-param>
      <param-name>rails.env</param-name>
      <param-value>production</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <context-param>
      <param-name>jruby.min.runtimes</param-name>
      <param-value>1</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <context-param>
      <param-name>jruby.max.runtimes</param-name>
      <param-value>1</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <filter>
      <filter-name>RackFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>org.jruby.rack.RackFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>RackFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

    <listener>
      <listener-class>org.jruby.rack.rails.RailsServletContextListener</listener-class>
    </listener>

## For Other Rack Applications

Here's a sample web.xml configuration for a Sinatra application. The
main difference is to place the rackup script for assembling the
Rack-based application in the 'rackup' parameter. Be sure to escape
angle-brackets for XML.

    <context-param>
      <param-name>rackup</param-name>
      <param-value>
        require 'rubygems'
        gem 'sinatra', '~&gt; 0.9'
        require './lib/demo'
        set :run, false
        set :environment, :production
        run Sinatra::Application
      </param-value>
    </context-param>

    <filter>
      <filter-name>RackFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>org.jruby.rack.RackFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>RackFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

    <listener>
      <listener-class>org.jruby.rack.RackServletContextListener</listener-class>
    </listener>

# Features

## Servlet Filter

JRuby-Rack's main mode of operation is as a servlet filter. This
allows requests for static content to pass through and be served by
the application server. Dynamic requests only happen for URLs that
don't have a corresponding file, much like many Ruby applications
expect. The application can also be configured to dispatch through a
servlet instead of a filter if it suits your environment better.

## Servlet environment integration

- Servlet context is accessible to any application both through the
  global variable $servlet_context and the Rack environment variable
  java.servlet_context.
- Servlet request object is available in the Rack environment via the
  key java.servlet_request.
- Servlet request attributes are passed through to the Rack
  environment.
- Rack environment variables and headers can be overridden by servlet
  request attributes.
- Java servlet sessions are available as a session store for both
  Rails and Merb. Session attributes with String keys and String,
  numeric, boolean, or java object values are automatically copied to
  the servlet session for you.

## Rails

Several aspects of Rails are automatically set up for you.

- The Rails controller setting ActionController::Base.relative_url_root
  is set for you automatically according to the context root where
  your webapp is deployed.
- Rails logging output is redirected to the application server log.
- Page caching and asset directories are configured appropriately.

## JRuby Runtime Management

JRuby runtime management and pooling is done automatically by the
framework. In the case of Rails, runtimes are pooled. For Merb and
other Rack applications, a single runtime is created and shared for
every request.

## Servlet Context Init Parameters

JRuby-Rack can be configured by setting context init parameters in
web.xml.

- `rackup`: Rackup script for configuring how the Rack application is
  mounted. Required for Rack-based applications other than Rails or
  Merb. Can be omitted if a `config.ru` is included in the application
  root.
- `jruby.min.runtimes`: For non-threadsafe Rails applications using a
  runtime pool, specify an integer minimum number of runtimes to hold
  in the pool.
- `jruby.max.runtimes`: For non-threadsafe Rails applications, an
  integer maximum number of runtimes to keep in the pool.
- `jruby.init.serial`: When using runtime pooling, indicate that the
  runtime pool should be created serially in the foreground rather
  than spawning background threads. For environments where creating
  threads is not permitted.
- `public.root`: Relative path to the location of your application's
  static assets. Defaults to `/`.
- `gem.path`: Relative path to the bundled gem repository. Defaults to
  `/WEB-INF/gems`.
- `rails.root`, `merb.root`: Root path to the location of the Rails or
  Merb application files. Defaults to `/WEB-INF`.
- `rails.env`: Specify the Rails environment to run. Defaults
  to 'production'.
- `merb.environment`: Specify the merb environment to run. Defaults to
  `production`.
- `jruby.rack.logging`: Specify the logging device to use. Defaults to
  `servlet_context`. See below.

## Logging

JRuby-Rack sets up a delegate logger for Rails that sends logging
output to `javax.servlet.ServletContext#log` by default. If you wish
to use a different logging system, set the `jruby.rack.logging`
context parameter as follows:

- `servlet_context` (default): Sends log messages to the servlet
  context.
- `stdout`: Sends log messages to the standard output stream
  `System.out`.
- `commons_logging`: Sends log messages to Apache commons-logging. You
  still need to configure commons-logging with additional details.
- `slf4j`: Sends log messages to SLF4J. Again, SLF4J configuration is
  left up to you.

For those loggers that require a specific named logger, set it in the
`jruby.rack.logging.name` context parameter.

# Building

Checkout the JRuby Rack code and cd to that directory.

    git clone git://kenai.com/jruby-rack~main jruby-rack
    cd jruby-rack

You can choose to build with either Maven or Rake. Either of the
following two will suffice (but see the NOTE below).

    mvn install
    jruby -S rake

The generated jar should be located here: target/jruby-rack-*.jar.

## Rails Step-by-step

This example shows how to create and deploy a simple Rails app using
the embedded Java database H2 to a WAR using Warble and JRuby Rack.
JRuby Rack is now included in the latest release of Warbler (0.9.9),
but you can build your own jar from source and substitute it if you
like.

Install Rails and the driver and ActiveRecord adapters for the H2
database:

    jruby -S gem install rails activerecord-jdbch2-adapter

Install Warbler:

    jruby -S gem install warbler

Make the "Blog" application

    jruby -S rails blog
    cd blog

Copy this configuration into config/database.yml:

    development:
      adapter: jdbch2
      database: db/development_h2_database

    test:
      adapter: jdbch2
      database: db/test_h2_database

    production:
      adapter: jdbch2
      database: db/production_h2_database

Generate a scaffold for a simple model of blog comments.

    jruby script/generate scaffold comment name:string body:text

Run the database migration that was just created as part of the scaffold.

    jruby -S rake db:migrate

Start your application on the Rails default port 3000 using Mongrel/
and make sure it works:

    jruby script/server

Generate a custom Warbler WAR configuration for the blog application

    jruby -S warble config

Generate a production version of the H2 database for the blog
application:

    RAILS_ENV=production jruby -S rake db:migrate

Edit this file: config/warble.rb and add the following line after
these comments:

    # Additional files/directories to include, above those in config.dirs
    # config.includes = FileList["db"]
    config.includes = FileList["db/production_h2*"]

This will tell Warble to include the just initialized production H2
database in the WAR.

Continue editing config/warble.rb and add the following line after
these comments:

    # Gems to be packaged in the webapp.  Note that Rails gems are added to this
    # list if vendor/rails is not present, so be sure to include rails if you
    # overwrite the value
    # config.gems = ["activerecord-jdbc-adapter", "jruby-openssl"]
    # config.gems << "tzinfo"
    # config.gems["rails"] = "1.2.3"
    config.gems << "activerecord-jdbch2-adapter"

This will tell Warble to add the JDBC driver for H2 as well as the
ActiveRecord JDBC and JDBC-H2 adapter Gems.

Now generate the WAR file:

    jruby -S warble war

This task generates the file: blog.war at the top level of the
application as well as an exploded version of the war located here:
tmp/war.

The war should be ready to deploy to your Java application server.
